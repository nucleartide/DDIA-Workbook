This repo contains my notes on the book *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*. I'm studying the book as part of [Wonder's](https://wonder.com/) Tech Book Club.

I like to follow an active learning approach of:

1. **Learning** by reading and taking notes
2. **Exercising** what was learned by asking questions about the reading
3. **Applying** what was learned by asking questions about how the concepts might apply to one's current software project, and
4. **Teaching** what was learned through presentations and writing

As such, this repo will soon evolve into a workbook of sorts. And it should serve as a good example of how to study a subject deeply.
